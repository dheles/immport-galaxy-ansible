# Ansible Project: ImmPort Galaxy

This is a test project to ansibilize [ImmPort Galaxy](https://github.com/ImmPortDB/immport-galaxy). I wouldn't recommend putting weight on it now, or probably ever. My goal at present is to use it to figure out the differences between ImmPort Galaxy and [GalaxyKickStart](https://github.com/ARTbio/GalaxyKickStart), with the longer term goal of distilling the ImmPort-specic bits into a role that one could add to KickStart.

This project is based on my [anseedble](https://github.com/dheles/anseedble) project, which differs in structure from KickStart, but it's the structure with which I'm familiar, so it'll do for now.
